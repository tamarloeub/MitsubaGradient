Cropped cloud from JPL, saved in rico20sn1024x1024x65_water_672nm.mat

With the following assumptions:
- Effective varince = 0.1031
- Albedo =1
- Wavelete 672[ nm ]
- Size distribution gamma
- Cross - section from mie function
- Lwc and effective radius data is from LES

extinction units are km^(-1)]nx spacing in km = 0.02
y spacing in km = 0.02
z spacing in km = 0.04
cloud indexs (xs:xe,ys:ye,zs:ze) = (366:444,780:864,12:38)
